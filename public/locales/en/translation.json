  "stroy.paraback1": "When the HeedPlay was still in his human form, he was a ruthless tyrant that led his people to victory. His country overcame war against various enemies through the use of deadly force and objective decisions. The HeedPlay showed no mercy to his enemies but was a good ally to his friends. He never abandoned a partner in battle nor let his worst enemies survive a fight. As he gained more knowledge to understand the world and become more powerful, he came upon the forbidden book – The Necronomicon.",
  "stroy.paraback2": "The HeedPlay was thirsty for knowledge and power which led him to ignore the warnings of his council and read the forbidden book. He spent weeks in his room, reading and analyzing each page and text. When he emerged from his weeks of seclusion, he was not a man anymore. He has become the Ape HeedPlay; a higher being that values reason and objectivity beyond anything else.",

  "storyCarousel.scene4": "Scene#4",
  "storyCarousel.para4": "Now, the Ape HeedPlay travels the world as a stranger that teaches men about peace and the sanctity of life. The Eastern and Western countries are in a constant war but the Ape HeedPlay decides to ignore the violence.",
